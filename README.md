A fun take on a Bayesian prediction for Matt Olson's 2023 OPS before the season started.

While I was learning in my Stat 306 Bayesian Statistics class, I wanted to create my prediction model using what we learned. It uses the JAGS package and such to draw from a prior and create a posterior that models what his OPS should have been for the 2023 season. Before the season started, it was actually in line perfectly with what ZiPS projected his OPS to be. I understand that at the time of this creation of the repository, he is far exceeding those OPS ranges, but this was made back in March before the season started.
